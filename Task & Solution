---> Question
The Nautilus Application development team has finished development of one of the applications and it is ready for deployment. It is a guestbook application that will be used to manage entries for guests/visitors. As per discussion with the DevOps team, they have finalized the infrastructure that will be deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Below you can find more details about it.


BACK-END TIER

Create a deployment named redis-master for Redis master.

a.) Replicas count should be 1.

b.) Container name should be master-redis-nautilus and it should use image redis.

c.) Request resources as CPU should be 100m and Memory should be 100Mi.

d.) Container port should be redis default port i.e 6379.

Create a service named redis-master for Redis master. Port and targetPort should be Redis default port i.e 6379.

Create another deployment named redis-slave for Redis slave.

a.) Replicas count should be 2.

b.) Container name should be slave-redis-nautilus and it should use gcr.io/google_samples/gb-redisslave:v3 image.

c.) Requests resources as CPU should be 100m and Memory should be 100Mi.

d.) Define an environment variable named GET_HOSTS_FROM and its value should be dns.

e.) Container port should be Redis default port i.e 6379.

Create another service named redis-slave. It should use Redis default port i.e 6379.

FRONT END TIER

Create a deployment named frontend.

a.) Replicas count should be 3.

b.) Container name should be php-redis-nautilus and it should use gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend@sha256:a908df8486ff66f2c4daa0d3d8a2fa09846a1fc8efd65649c0109695c7c5cbff image.

c.) Request resources as CPU should be 100m and Memory should be 100Mi.

d.) Define an environment variable named as GET_HOSTS_FROM and its value should be dns.

e.) Container port should be 80.

Create a service named frontend. Its type should be NodePort, port should be 80 and its nodePort should be 30009.

Finally, you can check the guestbook app by clicking on App button.


You can use any labels as per your choice.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.



---> Solution

1. Redis Master Deployment and Service:-

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-master
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis-master
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis-master
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: master-redis-nautilus
        image: redis
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-master
spec:
  selector:
    app: redis-master
  ports:
  - port: 6379
    targetPort: 6379



2. Redis Slave Deployment and Service:-

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-slave
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis-slave
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis-slave
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: slave-redis-nautilus
        image: gcr.io/google_samples/gb-redisslave:v3
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        env:
        - name: GET_HOSTS_FROM
          value: dns
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-slave
spec:
  selector:
    app: redis-slave
  ports:
  - port: 6379
    targetPort: 6379



3. Frontend Deployment and Service:-

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-redis-nautilus
        image: gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend@sha256:a908df8486ff66f2c4daa0d3d8a2fa09846a1fc8efd65649c0109695c7c5cbff
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        env:
        - name: GET_HOSTS_FROM
          value: dns
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30009
	
	
	
	
Notes:-
Redis master and slave deployments are separated, each with their own services.

Resource requests are set to cpu: 100m and memory: 100Mi for all containers.

Environment variable GET_HOSTS_FROM=dns is defined for both Redis slave and frontend deployments.

The frontend service is exposed via NodePort 30009, so you can access the Guestbook app at http://<NodeIP>:30009.
